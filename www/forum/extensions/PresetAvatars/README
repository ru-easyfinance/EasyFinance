===================================
EXTENSION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

In order for Vanilla to recognize an extension, it must be contained within its
own directory within the extensions directory. So, once you have downloaded and
unzipped the extension files, you can then place the folder containing the
default.php file into your installation of Vanilla. The path to your extension's
default.php file should look like this:

/path/to/vanilla/extensions/PresetAvatars/default.php

Once this is complete, you can enable the extension through the "Manage
Extensions" form on the settings tab in Vanilla.

ABOUT AVATAR IMAGES
===================

The pool of avatars that is visible to users consists of the files present
in the subfolder 'avatars'. Adding new avatars is as simple as copying
image files to that folder.

ABOUT CUSTOM AVATARS
====================

In order to allow users with the respective permissions to upload their own
avatars, the subfolder 'custom' needs to be writable.
