Extension: DisplayName

This plugin will display the 'Real Name' of users instead of their login IDs.

There are a few minor alterations to do to the theme, and some further comments
in default.php showing how to apply this fix to any plugins that display
login IDs.

I am releasing this extension in a fairly raw state (I know it is not finished)
to get it out there, and to guage the amount of interest in it.
