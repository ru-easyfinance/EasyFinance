===================================
EXTENSION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

In order for Vanilla to recognize an extension, it must be contained within its
own directory within the extensions directory. So, once you have downloaded and
unzipped the extension files, you can then place the folder containing the
default.php file into your installation of Vanilla. The path to your extension's
default.php file should look like this:

/path/to/vanilla/extensions/GuestPost/default.php

Once this is complete, you can enable the extension through the "Manage
Extensions" form on the settings tab in Vanilla.

===================================

GuestPost adds ability for users to post as a Guest user, with reCAPTCHA for spam prevention if wanted. It also adds a username/password box for unauthenticated users to login and post at the same time.

To install this extension, please first sign up (for free) on recaptcha.com and get your own public and private key. Then open default.php and paste the keys into the appropriate place (it is commented).

You will also need to sign up for an account on your forum that will be used for the guest posting. This could be any name you like (GuestUser, Guest, Anon). But make the password something that isn't obvious. Then put both these details into default.php in the appropriate place (it is commented).

Then install the extension as you would any other by ticking the box in the extensions settings.

You can see this working on spodesabode.com.

KNOWN ISSUES

If you are using the reCAPTCHA extension, it may well complain as reCAPTCHA will attempt to "include" the reCAPTCHA code again. In this case, GuestPost needs to load AFTER reCAPTCHA. This can be adjusted by editing conf/extensions.php and just moving the line of code for GuestPost to the end. I will contact the reCAPTCHA developers about this issue.

CREDITS
